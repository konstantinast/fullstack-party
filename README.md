6. In your shell/terminal navigate to project root dir. 
7. Run `composer install`.

10. Run `gulp build-predeploy-run`.
11. Cross fingers (mandatory step) :D
12. Open browser url `http://localhost:8080`
13. A primitive version of so called 'Single-page application' implemented using AngularJs 1.x should materialize before your optical input device ;) :) (or not ... :( if that is the case, then I could try setup stuff with more enclosed dev environment like Vagrant or something similar)

p.s. tested in .nix environment (Ubuntu 16.04), but with minor mods should run on Mac or Win too.
